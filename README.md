PLay the Pong Game using your brain through the Muse Headband and the Mind Monitor app. 

The player will start with an initial score of 6 and need to move the paddle by blinking: once moves it left, another time stops it, a third time moves it to the right, a fourth stops it, and the cycle continues... 

Whenever the player reaches the score of 6, the game terminates and loses the game. 

The gameplay area is 400 by 400 pixels with a blue backgroudnd, orange pong ball, and a red paddle signifying the colors of a real ping pong table.
